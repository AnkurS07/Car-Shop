Welcome to the repository for Group 15 of ECSE223 for Winter 2021. 
All code related to deliverables can be found here
Deliverable 1 has been completed.
The current version includes all work related to deliverable 2. In this deliverable we are implementing the controller of our system using BDD.

To start woring on deliverable 2, I recommend cloning the repo in a new project locally since the file structure was altered a lot. Also follow the TA instructions to get future updates from the TA. However, be careful not to overwrite the code that was added for deliverable 2 (i.e. use the command in the section "Incorporating published updates to the starter project" and NOT the section "Obtaining the initial project" after doing "git fetch -v".

Deliverable 1
Due date -> February 19th

Deliverable 2
Due date -> March 16th
